# Helper scripts
## Introduction
This repository contains some random scripts I wrote to simplify my workflow and is meant for my personal usage. 
It will not be actively maintained or updated but you are free to use anything you may find useful here.

## create_user.sh
This script creates a user with the home directory and ssh authentication set. To run, first provide a .pub file in the same directory and then run:

```bash
./create_user.sh [username] [optional:password]
```
